"We could make this more robust by..."
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Communication

❌ "Um... uh... like... you know..."
✅ Take a breath and pause instead

❌ Coding in silence
✅ Explain what you're doing

❌ "I don't know"
✅ "I'm not certain, but my approach would be..."

### Code

❌ Starting to code immediately
✅ Ask questions and plan first

❌ Not considering edge cases
✅ "What if the array is empty?"

❌ Over-engineering the solution
✅ Start simple, then optimize

## Sample Dialogue - Full Example

**Interviewer:** "Can you implement a function that finds the most frequent element in an array?"

**You:**

```
"Sure! Let me make sure I understand the requirements.
Should I return the element itself or its frequency?
And what should happen if there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency?"

[After clarification]

"Okay, so I need to return the most frequent element,
and if there's a tie, I can return any of them.
Let me think about the approach...

I'm going to use a hash map to count the frequency of each element.
Then I'll iterate through the map to find the element with the highest count.
The time complexity will be O(n) for counting and O(n) for finding the max,
so overall O(n), which is optimal.

Let me start coding..."

[While coding]

"First, I'll create a frequency map using an object.
I'm using a for...of loop to iterate through the array.
For each element, I'm incrementing its count in the map.
Now I'm initializing variables to track the most frequent element..."

[After coding]

"Let me test this with a few examples.
If the input is [1, 2, 2, 3], it should return 2.
For an empty array, it returns undefined, which makes sense.
The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is also O(n) for the hash map.

One optimization we could consider is using a single pass to track the max
while building the frequency map, but I think this is more readable."
```

## Remember

> "Interviewers are looking for how you think and communicate, not just if you get the right answer. A partially correct solution with excellent communication is better than a perfect solution with no explanation."

**You've got this! 🚀**

Good luck with your EPAM interview!
