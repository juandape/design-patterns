// 2. Implement LRU Cache with O(1) operations
// Must use HashMap + Doubly Linked List

// 3. Find all anagrams in a string
// Example: "cbaebabacd" pattern "abc" → [0, 6]

## 🎤 Sample Answers for Common Questions

### "Tell me about yourself"

**Good Answer:**

```
"I'm a full-stack developer with [X] years of experience, currently
working at [Company]. I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and
Node.js, building scalable web applications.

In my current role, I've [specific achievement - e.g., "led the
migration of our monolith to microservices, reducing latency by 40%"].

I'm particularly passionate about clean code and design patterns,
which is why I'm excited about EPAM's focus on engineering excellence.
I'm looking for opportunities to work on complex, challenging projects
with global clients."
```

### "Why EPAM?"

**Good Answer:**

```
"I'm impressed by EPAM's focus on digital transformation and product
engineering. Unlike typical service companies, EPAM works on
cutting-edge projects with Fortune 500 clients.

I appreciate that EPAM values engineering quality over just delivery
speed. The company's investment in employee development and the
opportunity to work with global teams aligns perfectly with my career
goals.

Also, EPAM's collaborative culture and focus on innovation really
resonates with my values as an engineer."
```

### "What's your biggest weakness?"

**Good Answer:**

```
"I tend to get very involved in technical details and sometimes need
to step back to see the bigger picture. For example, in my last
project, I spent extra time optimizing an algorithm that, while
technically interesting, didn't significantly impact the end-user
experience.

I'm working on this by starting every task with a clear understanding
of the business value and user impact before diving into implementation.
This helps me prioritize better and deliver more business value."
```
